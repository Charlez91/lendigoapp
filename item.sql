Until we have true general AI like we see in the movies, there&#x27;s no chance that an AI like AlphaCode could design software, and there&#x27;s no chance that it could write actual code because it wouldn&#x27;t be able to name variables. Because of these two things, AlphaCode will always need to take in very specific instructions and output incomprehensible code. Does that sound familiar? That&#x27;s essentially what a compiler does. There are only two differences that I can see AlphaCode ending up as compared to a compiler.<p>The first is that we could end up with a programming language that can accept natural language as its syntax. The best case scenario of this is that more people learn how to code as they don&#x27;t need to learn strict specialized syntax to program. However, whenever this topic comes up it always turns out to be more of a pipe dream, because when you are programming you want precision, and to have precision you need strict specialized syntax. In other words, the advantages of not needing strict syntax are small unless you are not a programmer, and the disadvantages are massive as you might be misunderstood and end up with hard to fix bugs.<p>The second possibility is that we could end up with generation systems that can build small, well defined functions for us, similar to the problems that AlphaCode is already solving. The problem with this is verifying correctness. As mentioned before, the code that AlphaCode outputs is unreadable. As such, verifying correctness would likely take longer than building it yourself. As a result, anyone needing to use small, well defined functions would be better off using the existing solution of human built libraries. Because libraries are shared between so many programmers, it is much easier for bugs to be discovered and fixed.<p>So for my summary, all AlphaCode really is, is yet another attempt at a natural language type of compiler, which even if it succeeds  wouldn&#x27;t affect programmers much as languages being well defined is critical for making sure everything runs correctly.', 'comment', NULL, NULL, NULL, 30182570, 'None', NULL, NULL, 0),

Oh, wow. That sounds amazing!<p>Let&#x27;s read further on...<p>&gt;&gt; At evaluation time, we create a massive amount of C++ and Python programs for\neach problem, orders of magnitude larger than previous work. Then we filter,\ncluster, and rerank those solutions to a small set of 10 candidate programs that\nwe submit for external assessment.<p>Ah. That doesn&#x27;t sound like &quot;critical thinking&quot;, or any thinking. It sounds like\nmassive brute-force guessing.<p>A quick look at the arxiv preprint linked from the article reveals that the\n&quot;massive&quot; amount of prorgams generated is in the millions (see Section 4.4).\nThese are &quot;filtered&quot; by testing them against program input-output (I&#x2F;O) examples\ngiven in the problem descriptions. This &quot;filtering&quot; still leaves a few thousands\nof candidate programs that are further reduced by clustering to &quot;only&quot; 10 (which\nare finally submitted).<p>So it&#x27;s a generate-and-test approach rather than anything to do with reasoning\n(as claimed elsewhere in the article) let alone &quot;thinking&quot;. But why do such\nmassive numbers of programs need to be generated? And why are there still\nthousands of candidate programs left after &quot;filtering&quot; on I&#x2F;O examples?<p>The reason is that the generation step is constrained by the natural-language\nproblem descriptions, but those are not enough to generate appropriate\nsolutions because the generating language model doesn&#x27;t understand what the\nproblem descriptions mean; so the system must generate millions of solutions\nhoping to &quot;get lucky&quot;. Most of those don&#x27;t pass the I&#x2F;O tests so they must be\ndiscarded. But there are only very few I&#x2F;O tests for each problem so there are\nmany programs that can pass them, and still not satisfy the problem spec. In the\nend, clustering is needed to reduce the overwhelming number of pretty much\nrandomly generated programs to a small number. This is a method of generating\nprograms that&#x27;s not much more precise than drawing numbers at random from a hat.<p>Inevitably, the results don&#x27;t seem to be particularly accurate, hence the\nevaluation against programs written by participants in coding competitions,\nwhich is not any objective measure of program correctness. Table 10 on the arxiv\npreprint lists results on a more formal benchmar, the APPS dataset, where it&#x27;s\nclear that the results are extremely poor (the best performing AlphaCode variant\nsolves 20% of the &quot;introductory&quot; level problems, though outperforming earlier\napproaches).<p>Overall, pretty underwhelming and a bit surpirsing to see such lackluster\nresults from DeepMind.', 'comment', NULL, NULL, NULL, 30179549, 'None', NULL, NULL, 0),

First, about the site you gave, here&#x27;s what BMJ has to say about this site:<p>&quot;Different websites (such as <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ivmmeta.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ivmmeta.com&#x2F;</a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c19ivermectin.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c19ivermectin.com&#x2F;</a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tratamientotemprano.org&#x2F;estudios-ivermectina&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tratamientotemprano.org&#x2F;estudios-ivermectina&#x2F;</a>, among others) have conducted meta-analyses with ivermectin studies, showing unpublished colourful forest plots which rapidly gained public acknowledgement and were disseminated via social media, without following any methodological or report guidelines. These websites do not include protocol registration with methods, search strategies, inclusion criteria, quality assessment of the included studies nor the certainty of the evidence of the pooled estimates. Prospective registration of systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis protocols is a key feature for providing transparency in the review process and ensuring protection against reporting biases, by revealing differences between the methods or outcomes reported in the published review and those planned in the registered protocol. These websites show pooled estimates suggesting significant benefits with ivermectin, which has resulted in confusion for clinicians, patients and even decision-makers. This is usually a problem when performing meta-analyses which are not based in rigorous systematic reviews, often leading to spread spurious or fallacious findings.36&quot;<p>Furthermore, in good faith I went and randomly looked at one of the studies cited that sourced a reasonable journal: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1002&#x2F;jmv.27469\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1002&#x2F;jmv.27469</a><p>The c19ivermectin site misrepresents the results from the study.  To quote the actual study: &quot;However, a mortality benefit was not seen with ivermectin treatment before and after PSM (p values = 0.07 and 0.11, respectively). ICU admission, and intubation rate were not significantly different between the groups (p = 0.49, and p = 1.0, respectively). No differences were found between groups regarding the length of hospital stay, ICU admission, intubation rate, and in-hospital mortality.&quot;<p>Additionally the study notes:\n&quot;The ivermectin group was more likely to have bacterial pneumonia complications compared to the control group (43% vs. 23%, p = 0.02). Eight patients had a pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis in the ivermectin group, and the ivermectin group more frequently received therapeutic anticoagulation therapy than the control group. In addition, 13 patients had acute kidney injury in the ivermectin group.&quot;<p>The website you provided has a very biased take on just the one study I looked at.
