Even if that isn&#x27;t a problem, property owners might want new cables buried. Even when power lines are above ground, sometimes they&#x27;re underground from the street to the house. Many houses might be set back from the street by 50 meters so it can be a larger distance. You can have a 300m road with 3 houses on it each with a 50m set back from the street.<p>That&#x27;s not to say it isn&#x27;t possible (and some towns have created coop ISPs), but costs add up.

It seems like it has very few people, but they all live in a small town center. Looking at Ucl\u00e9s, it&#x27;s the same: tiny place, but everyone is living in the town center.<p>Let&#x27;s look at Potomac, MD in the US. The roads are sprawling with giant houses all far apart. That&#x27;s a lot more distance to run fiber to get it to each house. Potomac is a rich suburb of DC and has fine internet (it&#x27;s still dense enough for that), but the US keeps sprawling. Look at a satellite view of Pike Township, PA. There&#x27;s a lot of houses with huge distances in between and no discernible town center.<p>&gt; If you manage to use electric or telephone posts deploying fiber and getting a carrier is doable<p>I think this can also be an issue in the US since place might not have easy&#x2F;cheap access to those utility poles. Title II carriers in the US get cheap, regulated access to utility poles. That&#x27;s traditionally been your phone company. I believe the FCC tried reclassifying broadband as Title II under the Obama administration, but it might have been reversed under the Trump administration. If you&#x27;re someone that already has access to the utility poles, you don&#x27;t want more people getting cheap access to them.<p>Even if you have access to the utility poles, you can face difficulty. As noted, you aren&#x27;t wiring up a town center, you can be wiring up places with a huge amount of distance between people. Even if that isn&#x27;t a problem, property owners might want new cables buried. Even when power lines are above ground, sometimes they&#x27;re underground from the street to the house. Many houses might be set back from the street by 50 meters so it can be a larger distance. You can have a 300m road with 3 houses on it each with a 50m set back from the street.<p>That&#x27;s not to say it isn&#x27;t possible (and some towns have created coop ISPs), but costs add up. Ucl\u00e9s has 140 people in it, but everyone seems to live within a 250m radius of the city center. That seems pretty easy to wire up.

First, about the site you gave, here&#x27;s what BMJ has to say about this site:<p>&quot;Different websites (such as <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ivmmeta.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ivmmeta.com&#x2F;</a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c19ivermectin.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;c19ivermectin.com&#x2F;</a>, <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tratamientotemprano.org&#x2F;estudios-ivermectina&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tratamientotemprano.org&#x2F;estudios-ivermectina&#x2F;</a>, among others) have conducted meta-analyses with ivermectin studies, showing unpublished colourful forest plots which rapidly gained public acknowledgement and were disseminated via social media, without following any methodological or report guidelines. These websites do not include protocol registration with methods, search strategies, inclusion criteria, quality assessment of the included studies nor the certainty of the evidence of the pooled estimates. Prospective registration of systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis protocols is a key feature for providing transparency in the review process and ensuring protection against reporting biases, by revealing differences between the methods or outcomes reported in the published review and those planned in the registered protocol. These websites show pooled estimates suggesting significant benefits with ivermectin, which has resulted in confusion for clinicians, patients and even decision-makers. This is usually a problem when performing meta-analyses which are not based in rigorous systematic reviews, often leading to spread spurious or fallacious findings.36&quot;<p>Furthermore, in good faith I went and randomly looked at one of the studies cited that sourced a reasonable journal: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1002&#x2F;jmv.27469\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1002&#x2F;jmv.27469</a><p>The c19ivermectin site misrepresents the results from the study.  To quote the actual study: &quot;However, a mortality benefit was not seen with ivermectin treatment before and after PSM (p values = 0.07 and 0.11, respectively). ICU admission, and intubation rate were not significantly different between the groups (p = 0.49, and p = 1.0, respectively). No differences were found between groups regarding the length of hospital stay, ICU admission, intubation rate, and in-hospital mortality.&quot;<p>Additionally the study notes:\n&quot;The ivermectin group was more likely to have bacterial pneumonia complications compared to the control group (43% vs. 23%, p = 0.02). Eight patients had a pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis in the ivermectin group, and the ivermectin group more frequently received therapeutic anticoagulation therapy than the control group. In addition, 13 patients had acute kidney injury in the ivermectin group.&quot;<p>The website you provided has a very biased take on just the one study I looked at.
